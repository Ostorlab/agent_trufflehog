  This command will download and install `agent/ostorlab/trufflehog` and the target file`.
  For more information, please refer to the [Ostorlab Documentation](https://github.com/Ostorlab/ostorlab/blob/main/README.md)
  ## Usage
  Agent TruffleHog can be installed directly from the ostorlab agent store or built from this repository.
   ### Install directly from ostorlab agent store
   ```shell
   ostorlab agent install agent/ostorlab/trufflehog
   ```
  You can then run the agent with the following command:
  ```shell
  ostorlab scan run --agent agent/ostorlab/trufflehog file [YOUR_TARGET_FILE]
  ```
  ### Build directly from the repository
   1. To build the trufflehog agent you need to have [ostorlab](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) installed in your machine.  if you have already installed ostorlab, you can skip this step.
  ```shell
  pip3 install ostorlab
  ```
   2. Clone this repository.
  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:Ostorlab/agent_trufflehog.git && cd agent_trufflehog
  ```
   3. Build the agent image using ostorlab cli.
   ```shell
   ostortab agent build --file=ostorlab.yaml
   ```
   You can pass the optional flag `--organization` or `-o` to specify your organisation. The organization is empty by default.
   4. Run the agent using on of the following commands:
     * If you did not specify an organization when building the image:
      ```shell
      ostorlab scan run --agent agent//trufflehog file [YOUR_TARGET_FILE]
      ```
     * If you specified an organization when building the image:
      ```shell
      ostorlab scan run --agent agent/[ORGANIZATION]/trufflehog file [YOUR_TARGET_FILE]
      ```
